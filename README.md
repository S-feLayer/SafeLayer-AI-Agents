# DataGuard - AI Privacy Protection

A comprehensive AI privacy shield and data loss prevention system designed to protect sensitive information when interacting with AI models and external APIs.

## Overview

DataGuard provides enterprise grade protection for sensitive data during AI interactions. The system automatically detects, masks, and secures personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, and other confidential information before it reaches AI models or external services.

## Key Features

* **Automatic PII Detection**: Identifies and protects personal information including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses
* **Financial Data Protection**: Secures credit card numbers, bank account details, and financial transactions
* **Custom Masking Rules**: Configurable patterns for organization specific sensitive data
* **Real Time Processing**: Instant detection and masking without performance degradation
* **Multiple Integration Options**: SDK, API, and direct integration support
* **Compliance Ready**: Built in support for GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install dataguard
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from dataguard_core.privacy_shield import DataGuardPrivacyShield

# Initialize the privacy shield
shield = DataGuardPrivacyShield()

# Process text with automatic protection
protected_text = shield.protect_text("My email is john.doe@company.com and my phone is 555-123-4567")
print(protected_text)
# Output: My email is [EMAIL] and my phone is [PHONE]
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from dataguard_core.privacy_shield import DataGuardPrivacyShield

# Custom configuration
config = {
    "enable_advanced_detection": True,
    "custom_patterns": [
        r"customer_id:\s*\d{8}",
        r"order_number:\s*[A-Z]{2}\d{6}"
    ],
    "masking_mode": "hash"
}

shield = DataGuardPrivacyShield(config=config)
```

## Integration Options

### SDK Integration

The DataGuard SDK provides the simplest integration path for most applications:

```python
from dataguard_sdk import DataGuard

client = DataGuard(api_key="your_api_key")
protected_data = client.protect("sensitive text here")
```

### API Integration

For server to server communication:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.secureai.com/v1/protect",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"},
    json={"text": "sensitive data"}
)
```

### Direct Integration

For maximum control and offline processing:

```python
from dataguard_core.privacy_shield.advanced_masking import AdvancedMasking
from dataguard_core.privacy_shield.enhanced_detection import EnhancedDetection

detector = EnhancedDetection()
masker = AdvancedMasking()

detected = detector.detect_with_patterns(text)
protected = masker.mask(text, detected)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
DATAGUARD_API_KEY=your_api_key
DATAGUARD_ENVIRONMENT=production
DATAGUARD_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Configuration File

Create a `config.json` file:

```json
{
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "detection_rules": {
        "enable_credit_cards": true,
        "enable_ssn": true,
        "enable_emails": true
    },
    "masking": {
        "mode": "hash",
        "preserve_format": true
    }
}
```

## Supported Data Types

* **Personal Information**: Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
* **Financial Data**: Credit card numbers, bank accounts, routing numbers
* **Government IDs**: Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, passport numbers
* **Healthcare**: Medical record numbers, insurance IDs, diagnosis codes
* **Custom Patterns**: Organization specific identifiers and formats

## Performance

* **Processing Speed**: < 10ms per 1000 characters
* **Accuracy**: > 99% detection rate for standard PII patterns
* **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for full feature set
* **Scalability**: Supports concurrent processing of multiple requests

## Security

* **Local Processing**: Sensitive data never leaves your infrastructure
* **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
* **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging
* **Access Controls**: Role based access control for enterprise deployments

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
docker pull dataguard/privacy:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 dataguard/privacy:latest
```

### Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dataguard-privacy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dataguard-privacy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dataguard-privacy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dataguard
        image: dataguard/privacy:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```

### Cloud Deployment

The system supports deployment on all major cloud platforms:

* **AWS**: Lambda functions, ECS, and EC2
* **Azure**: Functions, Container Instances, and VMs
* **Google Cloud**: Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and Compute Engine

## Monitoring and Logging

### Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Metrics

The system exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

* Request count and latency
* Detection accuracy rates
* Error rates and types
* Resource utilization

### Logging

Structured logging in JSON format for easy parsing and analysis:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "level": "info",
    "message": "Text processed successfully",
    "detected_patterns": ["email", "phone"],
    "processing_time_ms": 5.2
}
```
